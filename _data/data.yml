career-profile:
    title: Career Summary
    summary: |
      More than 15 years of experience designing and delivering enterprise software, with a strong focus on Telecommunications (BSS/OSS) and large-scale integration programs, evolving in recent years toward cloud-native architectures, API management and platform engineering.
      
      Over the last year I have been Tech Lead in CGA’s NSI (Novo Sistema de Informação) digital transformation program, leading the backend development and platform capabilities of a team shifting from legacy tooling to a modern stack. I own technical delivery across backend development (Java 21, Spring Boot 3.4.13, Apache Camel, Postgres), API Management (Google Apigee X) and IAM (Red Hat build of Keycloak running on OpenShift), hosted in Google Cloud. I work as a trusted peer to the enterprise architect, contributing actively to architectural decisions and long-term direction.
      
      I strongly embrace Continuous Delivery and "shift-left" practices, driving secure-by-design delivery in regulated environments: least-privilege access, strong security controls, extensive AppSec scanning, and developer enablement through a complete local environment mirroring remote setups to accelerate feedback loops.
      
      In parallel, I hold an organizational leadership role as Backend Development Chapter Lead at Celfocus, steering the backend technology landscape with architects and pre-sales, mentoring engineers, shaping training and career paths, and supporting hiring through interview design and candidate assessment.
